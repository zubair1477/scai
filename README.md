# **üö®üì£ NEURAL NETWORKS VIRTUAL WORKSHOP 6/23 üì£üö®**


Hello @everyone, We are excited to announce our first virtual workshop of the summer this Sunday, June 23rd at 7:30 PM. The workshop will be hosted in the Event Room on our discord.
In this workshop we will explore the fundamental concepts of neural networks, starting with the basics and progressing through key models like the Perceptron, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

From this workshop, you will gain hands-on experience with these powerful tools, learning how they can be applied to solve real-world problems in areas such as image recognition and data classification. Whether you're new to neural networks or looking to deepen your understanding, this workshop is designed to equip you with practical skills and insights.
