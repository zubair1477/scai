Hello @everyone, We'd like to thank you all for being a part of this special year with SCAI. Thanks to your support, we were able to host many events as the first Artificial Inteligence club at UTA. This was only the beginning. We have much more planned for this upcoming year, so stay tuned and don't miss out. We are also excited to announce that officer applications for the 2024-25 academic year are now open!! 

Whether you're an expert or just dipping your toes into the world of artificial intelligence, we invite all majors to apply! Your unique perspectives and talents are exactly what we're looking for to drive SCAI forward. Please submit applications by next Friday, May 24th 11:59 PM.
